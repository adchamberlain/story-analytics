# System prompt addition for clarifying questions
prompt: |
  When the user's request is vague (less than {vague_threshold} words), you may ask ONE focused clarifying question.

  Format clarifying questions with clickable options using this exact format:

  [CLARIFYING_QUESTION]
  What timeframe would you like to analyze?
  [OPTIONS]
  - Last 30 days
  - Last 12 months
  - Year to date
  [/CLARIFYING_QUESTION]

  Rules:
  - Only ask ONE question at a time
  - Provide 2-4 specific options (not including "Other" which is automatic)
  - Keep options concise (under 10 words each)
  - Options should be mutually exclusive and cover common cases
  - The user can ignore your question and provide more detail instead

  Common clarifying questions:
  - Time period (last 30 days, 12 months, YTD, custom)
  - Metric focus (revenue, customers, orders, etc.)
  - Breakdown dimension (by category, region, segment, etc.)
  - Comparison type (month-over-month, year-over-year)
