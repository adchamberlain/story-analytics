    Can build: ['Trial Signups: Number of customers who signed up for Free tier', 'Total Active Trials: Current number of active Free tier customers', 'LineChart: Trial Signups Over Time - Monthly trend of new trial signups']
    Cannot build: ['Paid Conversions: Cannot track upgrades from Free to paid tiers - no historical plan tier changes tracked', 'Trial to Paid Conversion Rate: Cannot calculate without conversion tracking data', 'BigValue: Overall Conversion Rate - Cannot calculate without conversion data']
    Explanation: The schema contains current plan tier information in both customers and subscriptions tables, but lacks historical tracking of plan tier changes. We can identify Free tier customers and when they signed up, but cannot determine if/when they upgraded to paid plans since only current state is stored.
    Alternative: Build a 'Current Subscription Status Dashboard' instead, showing: 1) Free vs Paid customer distribution by signup date, industry, and region, 2) Monthly Free tier signups trends, 3) Current MRR breakdown by plan tier and industry, 4) Customer acquisition patterns by industry and region. This would provide valuable insights into trial adoption patterns and current subscription distribution without requiring conversion tracking data.
