  PARTIALLY FEASIBLE
    Can build: ['Total MRR: Can calculate sum of MRR from active subscriptions (where CHURN_DATE is null)', 'New MRR: Can calculate MRR from subscriptions started in a given period using START_DATE', 'Churned MRR: Can calculate MRR lost from subscriptions with CHURN_DATE in the period']
    Cannot build: ['Expansion MRR: Cannot calculate plan upgrades - no historical plan changes or upgrade tracking data exists', 'Net MRR Change: Partially infeasible due to missing expansion MRR component', 'BarChart: Net MRR Changes by Month - Cannot show expansion component in waterfall view']
    Explanation: The subscriptions table contains MRR, START_DATE, CHURN_DATE, and PLAN_TIER which enables most MRR analysis. However, there's no historical tracking of plan changes or upgrades within existing subscriptions, making expansion MRR calculations impossible. The schema only shows current subscription state, not subscription history or tier changes over time.
    Alternative: Build a simplified MRR dashboard focusing on New vs Churned MRR analysis. Include: Total MRR trend, New MRR vs Churned MRR by month, MRR breakdown by plan tier, and net change calculation using only New - Churned (excluding expansion). Add a note that expansion MRR tracking requires additional data collection for plan change history.
